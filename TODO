loading kernel and passing control to it

kernel

to do before your kernel image can run, you will agree that this is not much:

determine which partition to boot from (either by looking for the active partition, or by presenting the user with a selection of installed operating systems to chose from);
determine where your kernel image is located on the boot partition (either by interpreting the file system, or by loading the image from a fixed position);
load the kernel image into memory (requires basic disk I/O);
enable protected mode;
preparing the runtime environment for the kernel (e.g. setting up stack space);
